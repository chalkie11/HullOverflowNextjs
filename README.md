Hi guys, I'm proud to present you my recent project:[fakeoverflow](https://fakeoverflow.vercel.app/)!

I wanted to explore new technologies such as Zod, Next.js App router, MongoDB, and Tailwind. I used to be very interested in CSS. People had different opinions about Tailwind, with some saying it added complexity to their JSX, while others found it to be a productive tool. In any case, I wanted to give it a try. Previously, my primary choice was Supabase, but now I'm experimenting with MongoDB.

This is a Stack Overflow clone. I intentionally deviated from the original layout to give it a fresh 2.0 look in the best way possible. I've put a lot of effort into replicating the functionality, and it's still a work in progress. Throughout this project, I've genuinely learned a lot. When I was using Supabase, I had to plan my schema in advance. However, with MongoDB, I found it easier to expand and improve the structure as I go, although I still have a fondness for Supabase ðŸ˜Š

I've invested a significant amount of effort into this project and I hope you'll enjoy it. Please consider showing your support by starring the project and following me on GitHub.
